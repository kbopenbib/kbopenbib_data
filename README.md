## About

The OPENBIB project, maintained by the [Kompetenznetzwerk Bibliometrie](https://bibliometrie.info),  
provides access to curated OpenAlex data with a focus on the German research landscape.

Curated data is provided for following entities: 

- [Authors](docs/data_overview.md#-authors) üë©‚Äçüéì
- [Publishers](docs/data_overview.md#-publishers) üìö
- [Funding information](docs/data_overview.md#-funding-information) üìÑ
- [Document types](docs/data_overview.md#-document-types) üóÇÔ∏è
- [Address information](docs/data_overview.md#-address-information) üèõÔ∏è

Annual snapshots from the OPENBIB project are openly available to users of the 
[Kompetenznetzwerk Bibliometrie](https://bibliometrie.info), via the 
[Open Scholarly Data Warehouse of the SUB G√∂ttingen](https://subugoe.github.io/scholcomm_analytics/data.html)
and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org).

The current release is based on the August 2024 snapshot of OpenAlex, limited to works
with publication years 2014 to 2024.

## Usage

### Address information

The following figure compares the assignment of publications to German institutions
in OpenAlex and in OPENBIB. While OpenAlex uses a probability model to match 
address affiliations in documents with institutions, OPENBIB uses a pattern matching
approach. The figure only displays institutions that are present in both 
OpenAlex and OPENBIB and can be assigned a unique Research Organisation 
Registry (ROR) ID.

</figure>

### Document types

The following figure compares the classification of article and reviews in OpenAlex
and in OPENBIB. OpenAlex counts more article and reviews than OPENBIB, because
OpenAlex also labels case reports, abstracts, book reviews and editorials
as articles and reviews.

### Funding information

The following figure compares the number of publications with funding
information of the German Research Foundation in OpenAlex and in OPENBIB. 
Only publications funded by the German 
[Open-Access-Publikationskosten](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/infrastructure/lis/funding-opportunities/open-access-publication-funding) 
program are considered.
