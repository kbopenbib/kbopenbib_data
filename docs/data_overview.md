## üë©‚Äçüéì Authors

The aim of curation is the automatic disambiguation of German Authors.

## üìÑ Funding information

Funding information is provided for publications funded by the
German [Open-Access-Publikationskosten](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/infrastructure/lis/funding-opportunities/open-access-publication-funding) program. 

Table: <i>dfg_oa</i>
<br>
Limitations: Only includes publications from 2022 to 2024
<br>

```bash
openalex_id: "W4321327768"
doi: "10.1002/1873-3468.14601"
funding_id: ["430651076"]
```

### Fields

- openalex_id (STRING): The OpenAlex id of this work.
- doi (STRING): The DOI of this work.
- funding_id (TEXT): The grant id(s) we found for this work. 

## üóÇ Document types

Journals publish different types of scholarly works such as
research articles, reviews, book reviews, case reports and editorials.
The latter are often classified as articles in OpenAlex. Using a machine 
learning classifier helps to distinguish between research
contributions and other types of works. 

Table: <i>classification_article_reviews_2014_2024_august24 (placeholder)</i>
<br>
Limitations: Only includes articles and reviews from OpenAlex with the 
source type journal and the publication year 2014 to 2024.
<br>

```bash
openalex_id: "W4256503663"
doi: "10.1016/s0099-2399(15)00667-6"
is_research: False
proba: 0.16
```

Examples of works that are considered as non-research publications by the classifier:
- https://openalex.org/works/W2264593839 (Abstract)

### Fields

- openalex_id (STRING): The OpenAlex id of this work.
- doi (STRING): The DOI of this work.
- is_research (BOOLEAN): True if our classifier detect this work as a research contribution.
